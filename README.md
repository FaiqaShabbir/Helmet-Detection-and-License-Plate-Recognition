# Helmet-Detection-and-License-Plate-Recognition
Road safety is a pressing global issue with millions of lives at stake. Motorcycle fatalities, in 
particular, contribute significantly to the alarming statistics provided by the World Health 
Organization (WHO), highlighting the need to address the lack of helmet usage among riders. 
In this project, our objective is to develop a system that can detect whether a two-wheeler rider 
is wearing a helmet and extract license plate information if a helmet is not detected, ultimately 
issuing an electronic challan. By employing computer vision techniques such as YOLO (You 
Only Look Once) for helmet detection and license plate recognition, alongside optical 
character recognition (OCR) for reading license plate information. 
We aim to create an efficient and accurate system. Using a camera or video feed for image 
capture and analysis, this technology holds potential for enhancing road safety and enforcing 
traffic regulations across various settings, including both urban and rural areas. The scope of 
the project focuses on implementing innovative technology that addresses the critical issue of 
road safety, encourages helmet usage, and ensures compliance with traffic laws. The successful 
implementation of this technology could significantly reduce the number of traffic accidents 
and fatalities, thereby contributing to the creation of safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and 
communities as outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This project 
represents a significant advancement toward establishing a more secure and sustainable 
transportation system that prioritizes user safety while revolutionizing the enforcement of 
traffic laws and regulations
